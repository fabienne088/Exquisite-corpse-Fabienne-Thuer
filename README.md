## What is a clarinet?
The [clarinet](https://www.britannica.com/art/clarinet) (Dutch: *klarinet*, French: *clarinette*) is a woodwind instrument with a single reed, a cylindrical bore and a flared bell. The body is usually made of [African blackwood](https://www.corbinclarinetproducts.com/blog/african-blackwood-in-clarinet-production#/) (dalbergia melanoxylon = grenadilla). The keys are made of metal and mostly silver-coated, nickel is also used.
